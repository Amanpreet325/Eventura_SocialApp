# **Social Media Dashboard for Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

## **Project Overview**

This project is a full-stack **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** application designed for managing users, roles, permissions, posts, and event venues. The system provides an interactive platform where users can log in with different roles (e.g., Club, Volunteer, Super Admin) and interact with features according to their permissions. The admin dashboard ensures secure and efficient management of users, roles, and venue bookings while offering tailored UI dashboards for each user type.

## **How It Works**

1. **User Roles and Permissions:**
   - User roles (e.g., Club, Volunteer) determine their dashboard access and allowed actions.
   - Only **Super Admin** can approve new users and posts.
2. **Post Workflow:**
   - A user (Club/Volunteer) creates a post.
   - The post enters a "Pending Approval" state visible only to the **Super Admin**.
   - After approval, the post is visible to all users.

3. **Venue Management:**
   - Admin adds new venues to the system.
   - Clubs can browse and book venues for events directly from their dashboard.

4. **Dashboards:**
   - Role-specific dashboards provide tailored UI experiences:
     - **Super Admin Dashboard:** Approve users, posts, and manage all system elements.
     - **Admin Dashboard:** Manage venues and view system stats.
     - **Club Dashboard:** Manage posts and book venues.
     - **Volunteer Dashboard:** Upload and manage personal posts.
